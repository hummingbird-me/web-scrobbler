# web-scrobbler

_This project is WIP and is experimental, should normally work with Chrome and Firefox._

Automatically tracks your episode progress on Kitsu when you stream anime from your browser. Works great with Crunchyroll, Hulu, Wakanim.tv and Anime Digital Network. Experimental with Netflix.
